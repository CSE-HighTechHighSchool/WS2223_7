She did not care about the enviornment at all and was a proud litterer. Her house's water bill got so bad that her parents shipped her away to nature boot camp. She came back a new woman. Ever since, she has been on a mission to bring clean water everywhere. Along with two of her classmates at High Technology High School, she decided to create a nonprofit. In her free time, Nidhi likes to watch F1 races and horror movies. She also likes to call her best friend Rebecca for three hours at a time. For some godforsaken reason, she loves to chew bubble gum (mint is superior).

She has first hand witnessed her abuse of water. One day, she snapped and couldn't stand by and do nothing. Rebecca convinced Nidhi's parents to ship her off to nature boot camp. After she returned, they were finally in agreement about their passion for the environment. They decided to found a charity to bring clean water to those who didn't have any. She is currently a junior at High Technology High School. In her free time, Rebecca loves to bike, swim, play soccer, play cards, and hang out with her friends. She calls Nidhi for four hours at a time and watches F1 with her.

Once hearing about the atrocities Nidhi was commiting, she felt the need to create a charity to sort of balance out all the harm Nidhi was doing. Once Nidhi returned from boot camp with a sudden change of heart, Emme had a great idea: What would be better than a reformed water delinquent cofounding a water charity? Nidhi and Rebecca both loved the idea, and they worked together to make it happen. In her free time, she loves to draw, do fluid dynamics practice problems, and test samples of water in the lab.
