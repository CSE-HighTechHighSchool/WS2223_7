                            <p>Before founding Drop of Life in 2021, Nidhi was a water deliquent that took 2 hour showers. She did not care about the enviornment at all and was a proud litterer. Her house's water bill got so bad that her parents shipped her away to nature boot camp. She came back a new woman. Ever since, she has been on a mission to bring clean water everywhere. Along with two of her classmates at High Technology High School, she decided to create a nonprofit.

                            <p>Rebecca has always had a passion for the enviornment. She has also known Nidhi for practically her whole life. She has first hand witnessed her abuse of water. One day, she snapped and couldn't stand by and do nothing. Rebecca convinced Nidhi's parents to ship her off to nature boot camp. After she returned, they were finally in agreement about their passion for the environment. They decided to found a charity to bring clean water to those who didn't have any. She is currently a junior at High Technology High School. In her free time, Rebecca loves to bike, swim, play soccer, play cards, and hang out with her friends.

                            <p>Research Practicum is the final required research course at HTHS. In this three-marking period course, you will set up and conduct the research project you proposed in ITR.  During this course you are  required to meet with faculty mentors (and outside mentors if you are working in another facility), conduct your experiments, analyze and interpret your results and draw conclusions relevant to the rationale for your research. You will then write a comprehensive research paper, integrating the knowledge gained in both ITR and this course. At the end of this course all students are required to give a professional quality oral presentation of their work.  You will also have the opportunity to enter your research into competitions such as the Jersey Shore Science Fair and the New Jersey Academy of Science Symposium. In addition to research and data analysis skills, you will develop skills in communication, time management, organization, decision making, resource allocation, scientific ethics, and  lab safety.
