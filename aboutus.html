She did not care about the enviornment at all and was a proud litterer. Her house's water bill got so bad that her parents shipped her away to nature boot camp. She came back a new woman. Ever since, she has been on a mission to bring clean water everywhere. Along with two of her classmates at High Technology High School, she decided to create a nonprofit. </p>						</div>
